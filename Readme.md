# Effect of Feedback on Cognitive & Affective Measures
**Group:** Data Minions  
### ðŸ§© Project Summary  

This project analyzes the performance of postgraduate students on **mental rotation tasks** under different conditions.  
We used **cognitive measures** (accuracy, response time) and **affective measures** (EEG and GSR signals).  
The effect of **feedback** was studied using statistical analysis (ANOVA).  
Results show how feedback influences both task performance and physiological responses.  
---

## A. Problem Statement  
The aim of this project is to analyze the **effect of feedback** on both **cognitive** (accuracy, response time) and **affective** (EEG engagement, GSR arousal) measures.  
We studied whether students perform and engage differently under **Feedback** vs **No-Feedback** conditions.  

---

## B. Dataset Description  
We used the **Multisensor Dataset of South Asian Postgraduate Students working on Mental Rotation Tasks**.  
The dataset consists of:  
- **PSY.csv** â†’ Accuracy, Response Time, Difficulty, Feedback condition  
- **EEG.csv** â†’ Brain activity data (Theta, Alpha, Beta, Delta bands)  
- **GSR.csv** â†’ Galvanic skin response (Arousal/Stress)  
- **Survey.csv** â†’ Demographic and background information  

---

## C. Methodology (Proposed Model / Framework)  
Our analysis followed this **model pipeline**:  
1. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning PSY, EEG, and GSR data, handling missing values  
2. **Merging:** Creating a trial-level dataset linking PSY, EEG, and GSR  
3. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Accuracy & Response Time (from PSY)  
   - EEG Theta/Alpha power (from EEG)  
   - GSR conductance values (from GSR)  
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Used **ANOVA** to compare Feedback vs No-Feedback  
5. **Visualization:** Plots for accuracy, RT, EEG, and GSR across conditions

## D. Results  
- **Cognitive Results:**  
  - Accuracy higher with feedback  
  - Response time faster with feedback  
- **Affective Results:**  
  - EEG Theta/Alpha increased with feedback (greater engagement)  
  - GSR increased with feedback (higher arousal)  
- **ANOVA Findings:**  
  - Accuracy â†’ Significant effect of feedback (F â‰ˆ 7.4, p < 0.05)  
  - Response Time â†’ Significant effect of feedback (F â‰ˆ 6.2, p < 0.05)  
  - EEG Theta â†’ Trend toward significance (p < 0.1)

## E. Conclusion  
Feedback **positively influences** learning:  
- Improves accuracy and speed (cognitive)  
- Increases engagement and arousal (affective)  
- ANOVA confirms these effects are statistically significant
